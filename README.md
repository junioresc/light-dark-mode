## Description

This site is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and was practice for implementing a Light and Dark mode feature. In the CSS, I implemented a different color palette specifically for Dark mode to switch values with the default Light mode. The site also remembers your preference and stores it in local storage and when revisiting the site it will look like it did during the previous visit. <br />
